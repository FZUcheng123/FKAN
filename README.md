Computers and Electronics in Agriculture

The code and sample data will be uploaded in time after the paper is published.
Currently, the mid-season mapping of winter wheat has been completed in 95% of global regions. The data will be promptly shared with the public upon completion. Please verify and correct any errors made by your colleagues.
